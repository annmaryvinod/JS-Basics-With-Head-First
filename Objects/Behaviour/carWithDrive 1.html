        var fiat = {
            make: "Fiat",
            model: "500",
            year: 1957,
            color: "Medium Blue",
            passengers: 2,
            convertible: false,
            mileage: 88000,
            started : false,
            start : function(){
                started  = true;
            },
            stop : function(){
                started = false;
            },

            // The "start" and "stop" methods set the "started" property to true and false respectively

            drive: function () {
                if(started){
                alert("Zoom zoom!");
            } else{
                alert("Please start your engine first!")
            }
            },
           

        };
    //   Calling the method!

//     First, we’ll try to drive the car, which should give us a message to start the car. Then we’ll start it for real, and we’ll drive it. Finally, when we're done we'll stop the car.

 
fiat.drive();

// We see this does not work. Check the console and you will find : "Uncaught ReferenceError: started is not defined at Object.drive (carWithDrive 1.html:32) at carWithDrive 1.html:46"


/*Why does this happen?
    1. JS could not identify which object's property is being talked about i.e it does not realise the "started" as the property of  the "fiat" object */

    
// Here we might need to use the "THIS" keyword to specify the object! Check the "carWithDrive2.html" file!
