    <script>
        var fiat = {
            make: "Fiat",
            model: "500",
            year: 1957,
            color: "Medium Blue",
            passengers: 2,
            convertible: false,
            mileage: 88000,
            started: false,
            start: function () {
                this.started = true;
            },
            stop: function () {
                this.started = false;
            },

            // The "start" and "stop" methods set the "started" property to true and false respectively
            // This refers to the fiat object!

            drive: function () {
                if (this.started) {
                    alert("Zoom zoom!");
                } else {
                    alert("Please start your engine first!")
                }
            },


        };
        //   Calling the method!

        //     First, we’ll try to drive the car, which should give us a message to start the car. Then we’ll start it for real, and we’ll drive it. Finally, when we're done we'll stop the car.

    fiat.drive();

        //   Now you may try all other methods and they'll work!
