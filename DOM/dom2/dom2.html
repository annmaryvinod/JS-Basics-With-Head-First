<!-- Notes! -->

<!-- 1. First, create a function named init and put your existing code in the function. -->
<!-- 2. You can call this function anything you want, but it’s often called init by convention -->
<!-- 3. The code we had before, is now in the body of the init function. -->
<!-- 4. In the we’re assigning the function init to the "window.onload" property. Make sure you don't use parentheses after the function name! We're not calling the function;
     we're just assigning the function value to the window.onload property. -->
<!-- The window object will call any function you’ve assigned to its onload property, but only after the page is fully loaded.  -->
