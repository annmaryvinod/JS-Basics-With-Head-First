<!-- Intention was to change the content inside the <p> tag with the id "greenplanet". -->
<!-- But since we put the script for this change inside the <head> tag, it is not working. This is because the script is loaded before the page. -->
<!--To tackle this problem you need to tell the browser to load the script once the page is loaded.  -->
<!-- This can be done by putting the script at the end of the <body> tag! -->
    <!-- Another method is to go for the "onload" property of the "window" object! {Check "dom2.html"} -->
